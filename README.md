## How to set up

1. Clone this repository
2. Change Directory (cd) into "frontend-ui" and run "npm i" to install all of the dependencies.
3. Run "npm run dev" to start the frontend.
4. Change Directory into the "backend" folder, build the jar file, and run it.

At this point, the frontend will be operating on port 3000, and the backend will be running on port 8080.
